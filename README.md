# Anomaly-Detection
Detect faulty machinery through ball bearing vibrations using a classification model on historical vibration data. The data distribution of normal and faulty vibrations vary greatly, so the dataset contains unbalanced data.

## Dataset
- Consists of log data from ERP system and machine data from MES. 

## Tasks
- Data preprocesssing using Windowing, Fast Fourier Transform, Resampling.
- Feature generation by Spectral Transformation.
- Handle unbalanced data using oversampling the minority class.
- Machine learning modelling using a binary classifier.
